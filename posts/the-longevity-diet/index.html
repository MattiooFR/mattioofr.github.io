.. type: text
--><p>A few years ago I got interested in the <strong>diet
science</strong>. I am in my 20s and I’ve never been fat or not healthy,
but still I thought that maybe there was ways of <strong>anticipating my
aging</strong> with a better diet. I read a few books and one made lots
of sense to me, which I tried to summarize in the following article. It
is a book written by Valter Longo about a mimicking fasting diet. The
idea is to have the <strong>full benefits</strong> of a water fasting
diet, while still eating specific vegetables that would not prevent the
body from getting into starvation&nbsp;mode.</p>
<h3 id="full-disclaimer">Full&nbsp;disclaimer</h3>
<p>I must say that this book, even if it seems to be baked by science,
is <strong>still a book</strong>. All the evidence that Valter Longo
shows <strong>needs to be replicated</strong> and explored more deeply
before this can be called a truth. I decided to try it because fasting
is not a very dangerous experimentation, but I would recommend anybody
reading that article to be cautious and not to take everything said here
for absolute truth. Don’t do anything stupid if you are not feeling
healthy and <strong>talk with your doctor before</strong>.
<!-- TEASER_END --></p>
<h2 id="what-do-my-body-gets-from-food">What do my body gets from&nbsp;food</h2>
<p>There are mainly three things that are being consumed when we&nbsp;eat.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>
<strong>Protein</strong> - used by the body to generate new
proteins,&nbsp;muscles.</li>
<li>
<strong>Carbohydrates</strong> - simple form (sugars in fruit
juices, candy, etc..) or their complex form (large chains of glucose
contained in vegetables). Simple sugar can enter circulation
immediately, increase blood glucose levels and trigger the rapid release
of insulin by the pancreas. The complex form must be separated from
other components in food and broken down into simple sugars before they
can be absorbed by the&nbsp;body.</li>
<li>
<strong>Fats</strong> - major source of stored energy in the&nbsp;body.</li>
</ol>
<p>The <strong>vitamins and minerals</strong> are the other family of
things that the body needs from the&nbsp;food.</p>
<h3 id="some-common-accepted-ideas-about-diet">Some common accepted
ideas about&nbsp;diet</h3>
<p>A diet rich in vegetables, fish, nuts and whole grains is the ideal
way to get the essential nutrients, except maybe for the vitamin D, and
for vegans and the elderly, the vitamin&nbsp;B12.</p>
<p><strong>Healthy diet</strong> : More vegetables, fewer fruits, no
dairy (milk, etc), healthy proteins, whole grains, healthy oils and stay
active. But eat&nbsp;less.</p>
<p>Saying breakfast is the most important meal in the day is
advertising, not science, so you better skip eat and only eat twice a&nbsp;day.</p>
<p>If you want to stay satiated and full of energy, rather than be
hungry and lethargic, you need to keep your insulin low, and fasting
seems to be a good way to quickly lower insulin&nbsp;levels.</p>
<h2 id="mimicking-fasting-diet">Mimicking Fasting&nbsp;Diet</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVArDzYynYc">Link to Valter
Longo video speech at&nbsp;TEDx</a></p>
<p><strong>1) Fasting and&nbsp;cancer</strong></p>
<p>Cancer is the <strong>second cause of death</strong> in the&nbsp;world.</p>
<p>Research found that when a cell has a change in its <span class="caps">DNA</span>, when certain
genes are modified through a mutation, they can become oncogenes. This
lets cancer cells divide more than what they should, regardless of the
signals they receive to stop dividing. That oncogenes characteristic
also make cells weaker and more vulnerable to the damage caused by
toxins, because those cells has the ability to disobey orders and
continue&nbsp;growing.</p>
<p>The idea is that if you starve an organism, it will go into a
<strong>highly protected</strong>, ingrowth mode, in a “shield mode”.
But cancer cells will disobey this order and continue growing even when
it is&nbsp;starved.</p>
<p>Imagine a fight between the Romans and the Carthaginians where they
are all mixed together wearing very similar uniforms. The common
approach of cancer therapies is to seek a magic arrow that will kill
only the Carthaginian soldiers, without harming the Romans, but this is
tricky because they all look the&nbsp;same.</p>
<p>Now suppose before shooting their arrows, the archers ordered the
soldiers, in Latin, to kneel and raise their shields. Because only the
Romans would understand the command, they would survive and the
Carthaginians would be hit by the&nbsp;arrows.</p>
<p>In this example, the Romans are the normal cells of the body, the
Carthaginians the cancer cells, the archers the oncologists, and the
arrows the&nbsp;chemotherapy.</p>
<p>If you starve a cancer patient before injecting chemotherapy, normal
cells will respond by putting up a defensive shield, but the cancer
cells will ignore the command and be more damaged by the&nbsp;chemo.</p>
<p>Trying this idea on mice showed promising results, the one that
starved combined with high-dose chemo were alive and moving around
normally. However mice on a normal diet were sick and moving very little
after chemotherapy, and 65% of those mice died the following&nbsp;weeks.</p>
<p>Where it gets better is that with really early cancer when you don’t
even know you have something, it is a natural process of the body to
target those weak cells when it gets on starvation&nbsp;mode.</p>
<p>Imagine a train burning wood to move. It runs out of wood and the
only option to get to the next station is to start burning seats from
the train that are made from wood&nbsp;too.</p>
<p>What the driver in charge will do is not taking out the perfect
seats, he will chose all the broken or old seats and burn them first.
The body does exactly the same, targeting first the weak cells or the
mutate cells and assimilate them to produce the energy we are lacking
due to the&nbsp;starve.</p>
<p><strong>Cancer cells love sugar</strong>, in 1924 Otto Warburg
discovered that cancer cells eat a lot more sugar than the normal cells.
That helped to create a technique to diagnostic cancer, the <span class="caps">PET</span> scan.
Giving a radioactively labeled glucose which light up when concentrate
in an organ. With cancer cells there will be a higher concentration of
this sugar in&nbsp;scan.</p>
<p>The basic form of sugar is called glucose. For the body to metabolize
the glucose and use it as energy, he needs oxygen, and the process form
carbon dioxide that the lungs will breathe out of the body. This process
can produce a loot of energy, but when the body needs more sugar and
oxygen is not enough, it can cut the use of oxygen and directly
metabolize the sugar but this will produce lactate. This is when after
long physical effort we start feeling exhausted, and pain in the
muscles, because body doesn’t really handle lactate&nbsp;properly.</p>
<p><strong>2) Fasting when you are&nbsp;healthy</strong></p>
<p>It’s been years that we already know how to improve mice and rats
life span, simply by <strong>reducing their food quantity</strong> they
live <strong>30-40% longer</strong>.</p>
<p>Fasting <strong>reduces inflammation</strong>, oxidative stress in
the organ systems, and you start burning fat instead of&nbsp;glucose.</p>
<p>The body transform and store the food you eat in the liver in form of
glycogen and that’s where the body uses the energy from first as
glucose. Only after 10-12 hours your glycogen stores get empty. If you
eat 3 meals a day, you will always have your glycogen stores in your
liver full and will constantly function on a glucose metabolism, except
if you exercise a lot. And can empty the storage&nbsp;faster.</p>
<p>When you depleted you glycogen stores in your liver, you start
burning fat and start produce what are called ketone&nbsp;bodies.</p>
<p>There are different ways to do fasting&nbsp;:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Long, water only fasting</strong> - 2-day fast each month,
or 1 week every 6&nbsp;months.</li>
<li>
<strong>Shorter intermittent fasting</strong> - Eating normally 5
days each week, and eating less than 600 calories the 2 other days (5:2
diet) / Consume food only during a 4-8 hour period each&nbsp;day</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Why does it work ? Why when you put animals on fasting they get
healthier, live longer&nbsp;?</em></p>
<p>Fasting is a challenge to your brain, and your brain responds to that
challenge of not having food by activating adaptive stress response
pathways that helps your brain against stress and resist&nbsp;disease.</p>
<p>Intense exercise has proven to activate similar reaction in the
brain, like fasting, it increases the production of proteins called
neurotrophic factors (<span class="caps">FGF</span>, <span class="caps">BDNF</span>). Those propose the <strong>growth of
neutrons</strong> and solid connection between synapses. It can increase
the production of new nerve cells from stem&nbsp;cells.</p>
<p>The production of ketones when you are on a fat burning metabolism
has great positive effects. Ketones <strong>prevent seizures</strong>,
ketogenic diet is used today to treat and help patients with severe
epilepsy today. Because ketone is an alternative fuel for the neurons in
the&nbsp;brain.</p>
<p>Due to the mild energetic stress imposed by the fasting and the
response of the brain to this stress, it increases the formation of
mitochondria which helps the ability of the neurons to form and maintain&nbsp;synapses.</p>
<p><strong>3) Fasting and neurodegenerative&nbsp;disorders</strong></p>
<p>Fasting reduce the accumulation of amyloid, or the degenerative of
dopamine neurons in Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s brain just by reducing
the energy intake. You can simply eat less at each meal, or do
intermittent fasting, reducing the frequency of the&nbsp;meal.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-aging">What is « aging »&nbsp;?</h2>
<p>Only one percent of the medical research is focused on understanding
why we age, and even less is devoted trying to do something about&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>The thing is that we are trying not to think about it, we feel
uncomfortable talking about getting older, and it feels normal to think
that we must have disease and a bad living conditions by getting&nbsp;older.</p>
<p><em>Aging is normal ! It’s part of human life, Alzheimer’s, heart
disease, cancer, they are all&nbsp;natural.</em></p>
<p>Well, that is what 99% of the medical research is focusing on it,
trying to slow down or heal those diseases, when the first cause might
not be that natural actually, and just some prevention and different
ways of living could reduce all those&nbsp;things.</p>
<p>We can even see in this graph that the quality of our aging is
decreasing over the&nbsp;years.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/longevitydiet/image1.png"></p>
<p>The goal is to get to <strong>90, 100 with a good
health</strong>.</p>
<p>Research found out there are genes that protect and even possibly
reverse aging. They are called the Sirtuins, there are some in our <span class="caps">DNA</span>
that has this job, and when you insert some of those genes in rats, they
do actually a lot better, they live longer and in a better health. The
goal now is to find a way to tweak, to activate those genes inside&nbsp;us.</p>
<p>When we age, our genes in our <span class="caps">DNA</span> start to get more and more turned
on, but in the <strong>wrong way</strong>. When we are young, it’s like
a well-played symphony, everything works as it is supposed to be, but as
chemical proteins and other things turn on and off our genes, they start
to malfunction, or stay on when they are not supposed&nbsp;to.</p>
<p>The Sirtuins gene produces special proteins that will go and eat
those chemical or other proteins attached to the malfunctioned genes and
are keeping them on. By doing this the genes will <strong>return in
normal states</strong>.</p>
<p>Those sirtuins, we found out that they are naturally stimulated when
<strong>we don’t eat and when we exercise</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="the-fasting-set-up">The fasting set&nbsp;up</h2>
<p>I decided that I would do a water fasting instead of this mimicking
fasting diet because I wanted to experience the hard way and I felt I
was capable of doing&nbsp;it.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="caps">DO</span> tell friends and family what you will be doing, why, and how they
can help you&nbsp;succeed</li>
<li><span class="caps">DO</span> prepare your environment too. If you know you are likely to
struggle with the temptation of snack foods, remove&nbsp;them</li>
<li><span class="caps">DO</span> ensure you will be able to take plenty of sleep, you may be more
tired than&nbsp;normal</li>
<li><span class="caps">DO</span> ensure you will have opportunity to be active with light
exercise, such as walking, interval training or&nbsp;yoga</li>
<li><span class="caps">DO</span> consider your workload and&nbsp;stress</li>
<li><span class="caps">DON</span>’T do Fasting Diet for the first time if you will also need to
manage higher than normal work, family and social&nbsp;demands</li>
<li><span class="caps">DON</span>’T perform heavy exercise such as lifting weights that will place
significant demands on your recovery&nbsp;ability</li>
<li><span class="caps">DON</span>’T do Fasting Diet if you have any unresolved health issue which
fasting might&nbsp;worsen</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="expected-calendar">Expected&nbsp;calendar</h3>
<p>Day one will be the hardest, hunger pain is there, <strong>keep
resisting</strong>&nbsp;!</p>
<p>Day 2 will provide a <strong>sense of calm</strong> when you wake up
you won’t be hungry&nbsp;anymore.</p>
<p>The other day, <strong>headache is normal</strong>, light-headed or
low sugar feeling is totally&nbsp;normal.</p>
<p>The last day, you’ll get really responsive to smelling food. You’ll
feel aware of everything around you, your brain will be so
<strong>accurate</strong>, it’s a really interesting&nbsp;feeling.</p>
<h3 id="what-can-i-eat">What can I&nbsp;eat</h3>
<p>Use electrolytes (salt) to maintain the proper amount in your body,
if you feel too much headache or lazy, the diet is working but maybe you
are in lack of salt so don’t hesitate to add a little bit more. 1/4 of
tea spoon in 1 L of&nbsp;water</p>
<p>Coffee and tea allowed, but <strong>don’t add <span class="caps">ANY</span> <span class="caps">SUGAR</span></strong>,
sugar is really prohibited and won’t let your body enter this ketosis
mode, and you’ll stay hungry until the end and it will be really&nbsp;hard.</p>
<ul>
<li>Electrolytes like magnesium and salt to replenish any loss through
water&nbsp;loss</li>
<li>Grass-fed liver tablets to provide micronutrient&nbsp;support</li>
<li>Greens powder to provide&nbsp;micronutrients</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to do the Mimicking Fasting Diet, the easiest recipe you
can do is to eat one avocado for lunch with two spoons of grass powder,
and one avocado for dinner with again two spoons of grass powder.
Avocado is mainly fat; therefore it won’t interfere with the body
depleting of sugar and switching to a fat burning process&nbsp;energy.</p>
<h2 id="getting-in-ketosis-fat-burning-mode">Getting in ketosis fat
burning&nbsp;mode</h2>
<p>Water fasting is the best way to get in ketosis mode, if you do
caloric restriction it can work but it s important that <strong>you eat
the right thing</strong>. 5% from carb, 25% from protein and 75% from
good&nbsp;fat.</p>
<p>If you eat less but still the wrong food, you will prevent your body
from entering ketosis mode, and the hunger will stay, with also a
feeling of lack of energy and loss of muscle&nbsp;weight.</p>
<p>If you eat too much carbohydrate, your liver will produce insulin to
break it down into glucose but this insulin block the action of the
lipase hormone which is necessary to mobilize fat and using it for fuel.
Grains or refined carbohydrates will provoke a much higher insulin
response than green&nbsp;vegetables.</p>
<p>If it’s done the proper way, you will lose fat, and burning more
energy, so feel more energetic, also get a better&nbsp;<span class="caps">VO2</span>.</p>
<p>When you are fasting, hu<strong>man growth hormone is also
released</strong>, and they mobilize large quantities of free fatty
acids from the adipose tissue, and use them to supply most of the energy
to the body cells. It will protect your muscles to break&nbsp;down.</p>
<p>Ketosis mode should happen during the two/third day of fasting, it
also depends on your previous diet, or the exercises you have every day.
Stopping exercise during a fast is the best way to not going fast into
ketosis mode, and losing muscles so <strong>keep moving</strong>&nbsp;!</p>
<p>Fasting reduce the insulin, but the insulin retains sodium, so your
kidney will have to release more sodium, and if you become in a lack of
sodium you’ll feel sluggish and hungry. <strong>Sodium is really
important for your body</strong> so 3 to 6g of sodium per day is really
something not to&nbsp;cut.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-detect-im-in-ketosis-mode">How to detect I’m in ketosis&nbsp;mode</h2>
<p>You can detect a change in your breath smell, fruitier like an apple,
can also feel metallic. It’s totally normal&nbsp;!</p>
<p>You can also feel more thirsty for water, because the body get rid of
the excess of sodium and water. To protect this, add a little bit more
salt than you were used too, 2-4g should be enough, and don’t forget to
drink a lot&nbsp;!</p>
<p>Don’t expect to lose weight, that is not the goal, and the only
weight you’ll lose will be fat, not&nbsp;muscle.</p>
<h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>
<p>The lower the better when you measure your blood pressure, waist
size, pulse, hs-<span class="caps">CRP</span> (it’s a measure of the inflammation happening all
over the body), and hbA1C (it’s the measurement of average blood
glucose). It can be a good way to track the evolution of changing your
diet. The last two require lab&nbsp;test.</p>
<p>Getting in ketosis mode will make those changes in you&nbsp;:</p>
<ul>
<li>Feeling less&nbsp;hungry</li>
<li>Lose more weight in the form of&nbsp;fat</li>
<li>Keeping more&nbsp;muscle</li>
<li>Having more&nbsp;energy</li>
