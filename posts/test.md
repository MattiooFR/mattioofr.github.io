# Create a blog with Nikola

**Where did I published that ?**

[Links](https://www.notion.so/3a091934f8e24469a9943df73a09a13d)

The first step is to have Python 3 installed on your computer, I recommend using virtual environment management, check out this article that talk about it.

Once you have create your virtual environment :

```shell
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
pip install --upgrade "Nikola[extras]"
```
